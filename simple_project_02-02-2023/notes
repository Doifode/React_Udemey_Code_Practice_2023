This app is simple this app covers the all the basic topics that have been  lerned 
first i create a portfolio.js werer the cards are actually gonn have means the code of the card
then the function component is exported ;
this component uses the props concept to render different content in the card ui 
in this jsx we happen to use bulma css like bootstrape 
and also props are used in it to change the content from it ;


App.js

app.js is our parent component 
props are one way communication thing 
we can only pass data from the parent to child with using the props.
in parent file we have to import the child component by using import statement and store it in to variable and use that variable
also in app.js file we have imported the images as well and store them in to variable like their path and the all information  
also the  bulma  css is also imported  inside the  app.js file by using the import statement
